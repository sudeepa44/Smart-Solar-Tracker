# Smart-Solar-Tracker
It is a solar tracking system which could apply to any solar panel to gain high efficiency from the solar panel. Project is complete by using PIC microcontroller. Solar energy is a demanding energy source to generate electricity which is an environment friendly solution for the energy crisis in the present world. Most of the time we have seen that there are fixed solar panels in buildings, rooftops etc.Our effort is to maximize the energy gain of a solar panel system by introducing a smart solar tracking system with embedded systems.
